TranslatePlural Helper
======================

The ``TranslatePlural`` view helper can be used to translate words which take into account numeric meanings. English, for example, has a singular definition of "car", for one car. And has the plural definition, "cars", meaning zero "cars" or more than one car. Other languages like Russian or Polish have more plurals with different rules.

The viewhelper acts as a wrapper for the ``Zend\I18n\Translator\Translator`` class.
