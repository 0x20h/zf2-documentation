Introduction
============

Zend\\Crypt provides support of some cryptographic tools. The available features are:

The main scope of this component is to offer an easy and secure way to protect and authenticate sensitive data in PHP. Because the use of cryptography is not so easy we recommend to use the ``Zend\Crypt`` component only if you have a minimum background on this topic. For a gentle introduction to cryptography we suggest the following references:
    - Dan Boneh "Cryptography course" Stanford University, Coursera - free online courses
    - N.Ferguson, B.Schneier, and T.Kohno, "Cryptography Engineering", John Wiley & Sons (2010)



.. note::
    **PHP-CryptLib**

    Most of the ideas behind the ``Zend\Crypt`` component have been inspired by the `PHP-CryptLib project`_ of `Anthony Ferrara`_ . PHP-CryptLib is an all-inclusive pure PHP cryptographic library for all cryptographic needs. It is meant to be easy to install and use, yet extensible and powerful enough for even the most experienced developer.
