HTML Object Helpers
===================

The *HTML* <object>element is used for embedding media like Flash or QuickTime in web pages. The object view helpers take care of embedding media with minimum effort.

There are four initial Object helpers:

All of these helpers share a similar interface. For this reason, this documentation will only contain examples of two of these helpers.

Additionally you can specify attributes, parameters and content that can be rendered along with the<object>. This will be demonstrated using the ``htmlObject()`` helper.
