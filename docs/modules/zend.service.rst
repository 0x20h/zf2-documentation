Introduction
============

``Zend_Service`` is an abstract class which serves as a foundation for web service implementations, such as *SOAP* or REST.

If you need support for generic, *XML* -based REST services, you may want to look at :ref:`Zend_Rest_Client <zend.rest.client>` .

In addition to being able to extend the ``Zend_Service`` and use ``Zend_Rest_Client`` for REST-based web services, Zend also provides support for popular web services. See the following sections for specific information on each supported web service.

Additional services are coming in the future.
