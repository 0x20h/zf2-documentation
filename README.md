### Welcome to the *Zend Framework 2.0.0* documentation

## RELEASE INFORMATION

This documentation is based on *Zend Framework 2.0.0beta5*

THE BETA5 RELEASE IS A DEVELOPMENT RELEASE AND NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE.
PLEASE USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

This is the fifth in a series of planned beta releases. The beta release
cycle will follow the "gmail" style of betas, whereby new features will
be added in each new release, and BC will not be guaranteed; beta
releases will happen _approximately_ every six weeks. 

Once the established milestones have been reached and the featureset has reached
maturity and reasonable stability, we will freeze the API and prepare for
Release Candidate (RC) status.
